<h2>Write about how you plan to use what you learned in this lesson to improve your CPT project.</h2>
<p>I can work to create a frontend for my page and make it look cool with some of the animations that I learned during this fantastic lesson!

more specifically, because my game has no frontend and is just ran in the terminal I can use this to make a fancy frontend which the user can see and put the input there rather than looking at the ugly terminal this can help my project become more presentable</p>

<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
<p>Start with a clear understanding of the requirements: Before creating wireframes, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the project requirements, the target audience, and the business objectives. This will help you create wireframes that align with the project's goals and meet the user's needs.

Keep it simple: The primary goal of wireframes is to show the layout and functionality of a digital product. Therefore, keep the wireframes simple, avoiding any unnecessary design elements or visual distractions.</p>

<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>
<p>User tsting is very important and the use of wire frames is also very useful to stay organized. AN example where user testing has changed the final product is during my own CPT project creation last trimester when we had other people give us their opinions and perspectives we changed up the color scheme and made it better because to us it was good however other people did not like it</p>
